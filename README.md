# gnome-shell Numix theme

**Note: I started with a gnome-shell Numix theme I downloaded a long time ago. It was not in a repo and I can't find it now, so I don't know who started this. By now, most of the changes are mine. But if you can point me to where I may have got the original so I can give proper credit, that would be appreciated.**

I built this based on what looks good on my system (currently Gnome 3.20). There are plenty of things that can be improved (see TODO items at top of the CSS file), and plenty of Gnome elements that I rarely use so I may not have tweaked them.

If you fix or improve something for your system, please share it with a pull request.

Also, this theme uses the font "Roboto". If you don't have that font, you can change it at the top of the CSS file.

## To install
- Put the Numix directory in `~/.themes`.
- Use gnome-tweak-tool and "User Themes" shell extension to set as gnome-shell theme.
- For best experience, use Numix GTK theme and numix-icon-theme-circle.
